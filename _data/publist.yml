  description: How to manage component level maintenance in large-scale wind farm operations? In this paper, an integrated framework that combines i) real-time degradation models used for predicting remaining life distribution of each component, with ii) mixed integer optimization models and solution algorithms used for identifying optimal wind farm maintenance and operations is proposed.
