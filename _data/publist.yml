- title: "Integrated Predictive Analytics & Optimization for Wind Farm Maintenance and Operations"
  image: WindFarm.png
  description: This paper proposes an integrated framework for wind farm maintenance that combines i) predictive analytics methodology that uses real-time sensor data to predict future degradation and remaining lifetime of wind turbines, with ii) a novel optimization model that transforms these predictions into profit-optimal maintenance and operational decisions for wind farms. To date, most applications of predictive analytics focus on single turbine systems. In contrast, this paper provides a seamless integration of the predictive analytics with decision making for a fleet of wind turbines.
